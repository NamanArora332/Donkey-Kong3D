Hi there the LBP 3 alpha port project is not completely perfect as for some reason my
obj change the way I save them so here how to fix the models. The only thing you need to do is 
to check the normal map and spec textures are set to non color. That's all really if you plan 
make a mod from the models the only thing I ask is you to credit me that's all goodbye.
